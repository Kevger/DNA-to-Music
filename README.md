## About the project
The author has already attempted to create an artistic counterpart to the reductionist, transparent, incapacitating development of the neurosciences and neuromarketing by using their tools. Subsequently artistic interpretations of the transparent and structure-determined DNA are now to be implemented analogous to the biotechnological and genetic development. Behind every digital image, text or video there are ones or zeros, which receive their form and meaning exclusively through algorithmic interpretation. In the same way, behind every living being, no matter how different they seem to be, according to reductionist genetics there are only base sequences of A, G, C and T.

There are unlimited possibilities to interpret things like DNA artistically. In nature, DNA is read sequentially, or rather interpreted sequentially. Therefore DNA is also sequentially structured so that the sequentiell interpretation makes sense or vice versa. To interpret this sequential structure, it also makes sense to use a sequential interpretation. Probably the most feasible way of an artistic algorithmic sequential interpretation is the generation of sound, which is why the attempt is made to create music from DNA. In nature, proteins also maintain their function through their specific sequential sequence of amino acids. The proteins are assembled on the basis of the sequential sequence of codons in the DNA. Instead of always reading dry words and structural formulas when dealing with biology, it would be interesting to listen to soulful sounds that have their origin in the blueprint of life. Not everybody understands structural formulas, but everybody understands music, even if this understanding is not rational, but rather sensual. Furthermore, why not convert the language of DNA into human language, since we already use letters to represent bases and amino acids? The attempt of a speech synthesis on the basis of DNA was also dared here in an experimental version.
## TLDR
With this tool you can transform any DNA and RNA into sounds and music. You can choose from a variety of instruments and synthesizers that can be combined to create even orchestral sounds. The settings let you choose the beat, key signature, instruments, start index, start delay, note spectrum and algorithm to be used. With a little sensitivity, you can even get musical experiences out of pathogens.


## The long explanation about this project
            What is man? A question which, even before Immanuel Kant posed it in
            his lecture on logic [1, p. 25], had countless answers ranging from
            zõon lógon échon and zõon politikón (the rational and political
            animal, Aristoteles) to the image of God. Today, 239 years later –
            and in times of physics, genetics, psychology, biotechnology,
            artificial intelligence and above all the advancing material
            reductionism – the question is more relevant than ever.
           
            In 1913, environmentalism was taken to extremes with the behaviorism
            of J.B. Watson, who argued that the environment is the only thing
            that makes up a person, including his emotional life. There is no
            such thing as self-observation, he reacts according to a
            stimulus-response scheme [5], the human being is entirely a product
            of his environment.
            
            Ten years later, after having previously used psychoanalysis,
            including self-observation, to define the subconscious as the
            driving force behind our actions, Sigmund Freud reduced the human
            being to an apparatus in The Ego and the Id [6].
            
            Years earlier, with the Nobel Prize 1906 awarded to Camillo Golgi
            and Santiago Ramon y Cajal for their research into the structure of
            the nervous system [7], a corner stone was laid for today's
            neurosciences and the associated reduction of the human being to a
            mere quantitatively measurable neuron activity. While behaviorism
            already led to the targeted manipulation of humans by means of
            successes ranging from conditioning to nudging, neuroscience and
            computer science promise far more profound possibilities to reduce
            humans to a Pavlovian dog [8, 9].
            
            The shift from classical marketing to neuromarketing [10, 11] and
            Silicon Valley's increasing investment in brain research [12] show
            that reductionist neuroscience will continue to expand its lead over
            classical psychology in the reduction of the human being. The human
            being here is predominantly a determined and transparent product of
            his neurons.
            
            Hundreds of years after Aristotle, man was raised to the image of
            God, but in 1859 with the creation of the species Darwin brought him
            back into the animal kingdom [13]. If the above developments mark a
            reduction of man according to the top-down principle, Gregor Mendel
            seven years later, with his Mendel's rules [14], set the beginning
            of genetics and the accompanying reduction according to the
            bottom-up principle. One year later, Francis Galton founded
            behavioural genetics [15], the reduction of behaviour to genetic
            predispositions. Building on both, together with the discovery of
            chromosomes and their underlying genes, unscientific methods and
            political objectives launched eugenics, race theory, and the age of
            Social Darwinism under the guise of scholarliness [16]. Whereas in
            behaviorism and classical psychology one could still partially
            protect oneself from reduction by consciously behaving differently
            or by lying, in Social Darwinism one was and is a determined,
            transparent product of one's origin and thus of one's genes. The
            idea that efficiency, intelligence and morality were determined by
            heredity lost its charm after its sad National Socialist peak and
            has since been hushed up, especially in the German-speaking world.
            With the discovery of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), its double helix
            [17] and genetic engineering [18], founded in 1971, man was elevated
            above evolution and given the tools to change life to suit his
            taste. With the Human Genome Project in 2001, the human genome was
            finally completely decoded to its bases [19].At the same time, man
            was reduced to a genetically determined, transparent product of his
            base sequence.
            
            In 2018, these tools were applied to the decoded human genome,
            produced genetically modified offspring [20] and thus initiated a
            development that may not be stopped. External determination by
            origin, gives way to prenatal external determination by genetic
            engineers. Eugenics and Social Darwinism could experience a
            dangerous and profound renaissance through these biotechnological
            developments.
            
            Although the foundations for the patenting of genetically modified
            organisms have already been laid, such as by the EU Directive
            98/44/EC, that directive still prevents dystopian visions of the
            future from becoming reality by excluding gene patents that
            intervene in the human germ line [21].
            
            In the case that individual genes for human modification can ever be
            patented – keyword designer babies [22], the aforementioned
            conditioning and neuromarketing – we as mankind are about to answer
            the fourth Kantian question asked at the beginning – what is the
            human being – as neither a product of its base sequence nor as a
            product of its neurons, but completely reduced to solely product.
            
            Both supporting and parallel to these developments, the development
            of artificial intelligence [23], the foundations of which were laid
            in the last century, is currently proceeding at a rapid pace.
            Nowadays, AI reduces humans completely to the data traces they
            voluntarily leave behind in their daily lives, which are shaped by
            Instagram, Google, Amazon and the others. At the same time, wherever
            AI enters the scene, from diagnostics [24], to production [25], to
            human leisure activities [26], it knocks human intelligence from its
            throne. A predicted mass unemployment [27], in which all sectors,
            including the creative industries, will be affected [28], is pushing
            people into insignificance. In view of a future technical
            singularity, the fourth Kantian question can possibly in the future
            be answered with „irrelevant“.
            
            The author has already attempted to create an artistic counterpart
            to the reductionist, transparent, incapacitating development of the
            neurosciences and neuromarketing by using their tools. Subsequently
            artistic interpretations of the transparent and structure-determined
            DNA are now to be implemented analogous to the biotechnological and
            genetic development. Behind every digital image, text or video there
            are ones or zeros, which receive their form and meaning exclusively
            through algorithmic interpretation. In the same way, behind every
            living being, no matter how different they seem to be, according to
            reductionist genetics there are only base sequences of A, G, C and T.
            
            There are unlimited possibilities to interpret things like DNA
            artistically. In nature, DNA is read sequentially, or rather
            interpreted sequentially. Therefore DNA is also sequentially
            structured so that the sequentiell interpretation makes sense or
            vice versa. To interpret this sequential structure, it also makes
            sense to use a sequential interpretation. Probably the most feasible
            way of an artistic algorithmic sequential interpretation is the
            generation of sound, which is why the attempt is made to create
            music from DNA. In nature, proteins also maintain their function
            through their specific sequential sequence of amino acids. The
            proteins are assembled on the basis of the sequential sequence of
            codons in the DNA. Instead of always reading dry words and
            structural formulas when dealing with biology, it would be
            interesting to listen to soulful sounds that have their origin in
            the blueprint of life. Not everybody understands structural
            formulas, but everybody understands music, even if this
            understanding is not rational, but rather sensual. Furthermore, why
            not convert the language of DNA into human language, since we
            already use letters to represent bases and amino acids? The attempt
            of a speech synthesis on the basis of DNA was also dared here in an
            experimental version. In the future other sequential interpretation
            forms like texts, scripts including movies might be imaginable.
            
            Through artistic interpretations of (one's own) DNA, man freely
            defines its meaning. Contrary to fixed value judgements such as good
            or bad, high or low quality, proficient or lazy, he distances
            himself, places himself as an interpreter and no longer as a
            determined, transparent product and thus as an individual above this
            sequence of elements. He becomes more than the sum of his bases.
